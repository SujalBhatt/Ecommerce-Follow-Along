üöÄ Key Concepts
What is a Sign-Up Page?
The Sign-Up page allows users to input their details to create an account. Typical fields include:

Name
Email
Password
This page will send user information to the server for processing.
What is Form Validation?
Form validation ensures that user inputs are correct and in the proper format:

Email format validation ensures the email entered is in the correct format (e.g., user@example.com).
Password validation checks for:
Minimum 6 characters.
At least one uppercase letter.
At least one number.
At least one special character. Form validation prevents errors and ensures the backend receives clean and valid data.
